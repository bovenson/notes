### open函数

语法：

```
file object = open(file_name [, access_mode][, buffering])
```

- **file_name**： The file_name argument is a string value that contains the name of the file that you want to access.
- **access_mode**： The access_mode determines the mode in which the file has to be opened, i.e., read, write, append, etc. A complete list of possible values is given below in the table. This is an optional parameter and the default file access mode is read (r).
- **buffering**： If the buffering value is set to 0, no buffering takes place. If the buffering value is 1, line buffering is performed while accessing a file. If you specify the buffering value as an integer greater than 1, then buffering action is performed with the indicated buffer size. If negative, the buffer size is the system default(default behavior).

```python
with open('filename', 'w') as f:
    f.write('A')
```

### 模式

| 符号   | 说明                                       |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| r    | Opens a file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode. |
| rb   | Opens a file for reading only in binary format. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode. |
| r+   | Opens a file for both reading and writing. The file pointer placed at the beginning of the file. |
| rb+  | Opens a file for both reading and writing in binary format. The file pointer placed at the beginning of the file. |
| w    | Opens a file for writing only. Overwrites the file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for writing. |
| wb   | Opens a file for writing only in binary format. Overwrites the file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for writing. |
| w+   | Opens a file for both writing and reading. Overwrites the existing file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for reading and writing. |
| wb+  | Opens a file for both writing and reading in binary format. Overwrites the existing file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for reading and writing. |
| a    | Opens a file for appending. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. That is, the file is in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing. |
| ab   | Opens a file for appending in binary format. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. That is, the file is in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing. |
| a+   | Opens a file for both appending and reading. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. The file opens in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for reading and writing. |
| ab+  | Opens a file for both appending and reading in binary format. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. The file opens in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for reading and writing. |
